  <h1>Bloody Christmas</h1>
  
  <p>Itâ€™s the most wonderful time of the year. The children are crying, the old man is dying. Krampus is near, but little Joseph does not feel any fear. 
Krampus is hungry, waiting for his next treat, and joseph seems just perfect to eat.
WIll Krampus be beat or will Joseph be another Christmas treat.
